38399524_.tx.2 Background and Objectives: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in Taiwan.


38399524_.tx.3 With rapid advancement of targeted therapeutics in non-small cell lung cancers, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming an important tool for biomarker testing.

38399524_.tx.4 In this study, we describe institutional experience of NGS analysis in non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC).


38399524_.tx.5 Materials and Methods: A cohort of 73 cases was identified from the institutional pathology archive in the period between November 2020 and December 2022.


38399524_.tx.6 Results: Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type (91.8%).


38399524_.tx.7 Most patients presented with stage IIIB and beyond (87.7%).


38399524_.tx.8 Twenty-nine patients (39.7%) were evaluated at the time of initial diagnosis, while the others had received prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy.


38399524_.tx.9 The most frequently mutated gene was EGFR (63%), and this was followed by TP53 (50.7%), KRAS (13.7%), RB1 (13.7%), and CDKN2A (13.7%).


38399524_.tx.10 Clinically actionable mutations associated with a guideline-suggested targeted therapy were identified in 55 cases (75.3%) overall, and in 47.1% of cases excluding EGFR TKI-sensitizing mutation.


38399524_.tx.11 Biomarkers other than EGFR TKI-sensitizing mutations were compared.


38399524_.tx.12 Cases without TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutation had more level 1 or 2 biomarkers (excluding EGFR TKI-sensitizing mutations) than cases with TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations (47.1% versus 20.1%, p = 0.016).


38399524_.tx.13 Progressive disease was associated with co-occurrence of clinically actionable mutations (20.5% versus 0%, p < 0.05).


38399524_.tx.14 Eight of the nine cases with co-occurring actionable genetic alternations had an EGFR mutation.


38399524_.tx.15 After an NGS test, 46.1% of actionable or potentially actionable genetic alternations led to patients receiving a matched therapy.


38399524_.tx.16 Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that NGS analysis identifies therapeutic targets and may guide treatment strategies in NSCLC.


38399524_.tx.17 NGS tests may be advantageous over multiple single-gene tests for optimization of treatment plans, especially for those with non-EGFR mutations or those with progressive disease.

38398199_.tx.4 The term AVPC does not describe a specific histologic subtype of PC but rather the group of tumors that, irrespective of morphology, show an aggressive clinical course, dictated by androgen receptor (AR) indifference.


38398199_.tx.5 AR indifference represents an adaptive response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), driven by epithelial plasticity, an inherent ability of tumor cells to adapt to their environment by changing their phenotypic characteristics in a bi-directional way.


38398199_.tx.6 The molecular profile of AVPC entails combined alterations in the tumor suppressor genes retinoblastoma protein 1 (RB1), tumor protein 53 (TP53), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).


38398199_.tx.7 The understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of castration-resistant PC (CRPC) and the need to identify the subset of patients that would potentially benefit from specific therapies necessitate the development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

38398114_.tx.4 The molecular mechanisms by which this activation elicits cell molecular changes need to be determined.


38398114_.tx.5 This is critical to identify dependable biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of tumours, and for the development of personalised treatment.


38398114_.tx.6 In this investigation we have identified and validated a gene signature for the prognosis of neuroblastoma using genes differentially expressed upon activation of the NTRK1-PTPN6-TP53 module.


38398114_.tx.7 A random survival forest model was used to construct a gene signature, which was then assessed across validation datasets using Kaplan-Meier analysis and ROC curves.


38398114_.tx.8 The analysis demonstrated that high BASP1, CD9, DLG2, FNBP1, FRMD3, IL11RA, ISGF10, IQCE, KCNQ3, and TOX2, and low BSG/CD147, CCDC125, GABRB3, GNB2L1/RACK1 HAPLN4, HEBP2, and HSD17B12 expression was significantly associated with favourable patient event-free survival (EFS).


38398114_.tx.9 The gene signature was associated with favourable tumour histology and NTRK1-PTPN6-TP53 module activation.


38398114_.tx.10 Importantly, all genes were significantly associated with favourable EFS in an independent manner.


38398114_.tx.11 Six of the signature genes, BSG/CD147, GNB2L1/RACK1, TXNDC5, FNPB1, B3GAT1, and IGSF10, play a role in cell differentiation.


38398114_.tx.12 Our findings strongly suggest that the identified gene signature is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for neuroblastoma patients and that it is associated with neuroblastoma cell differentiation through the activation of the NTRK1-PTPN6-TP53 module.

38395437_.tx.2 Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mostly characterised by HBV integrations, is prevalent worldwide.


38395437_.tx.3 Previous HBV studies mainly focused on a few hotspot integrations.


38395437_.tx.4 However, the oncogenic role of the other HBV integrations remains unclear.


38395437_.tx.5 This study aimed to elucidate HBV integration-induced tumourigenesis further.


38395437_.tx.6 Here, we illuminated the genomic structures encompassing HBV integrations in 124 HCCs across ages using whole genome sequencing and Nanopore long reads.


38395437_.tx.7 We classified a repertoire of integration patterns featured by complex genomic rearrangement.


38395437_.tx.8 We also conducted a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gain-of-function genetic screen in mouse hepatocytes.

38395437_.tx.10 These HBV-mediated rearrangements are significantly enriched in a bridge-fusion-bridge pattern and interchromosomal translocations, and frequently led to a wide range of aberrations including driver copy number variations in chr 4q, 5p (TERT), 6q, 8p, 16q, 9p (CDKN2A/B), 17p (TP53) and 13q (RB1), and particularly, ultra-early amplifications in chr8q.


38395437_.tx.11 Integrated HBV frequently contains complex structures correlated with the translocation distance.


38395437_.tx.12 Paired breakpoints within each integration event usually exhibit different microhomology, likely mediated by different DNA repair mechanisms.


38395437_.tx.13 HBV-mediated rearrangements significantly correlated with young age, higher HBV DNA level and TP53 mutations but were less prevalent in the patients subjected to prior antiviral therapies.

38393464_.tx.2 Metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary origin to the head and neck lymph nodes (HNCUP) engenders unique diagnostic considerations.


38393464_.tx.3 In many cases, the detection of a high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) unearths an occult oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).


38393464_.tx.4 In metastatic HR-HPV-independent carcinomas, other primary sites should be considered, including cutaneous malignancies that can mimic HR-HPV-associated SCC.


38393464_.tx.5 In this context, ultraviolet (UV) signature mutations, defined as Ã¢ Â¥Ã¢  60% CÃ¢  T substitutions with Ã¢ Â¥Ã¢  5% CCÃ¢  TT substitutions at dipyrimidine sites, identified in tumors arising on sun exposed areas, are an attractive and underused tool in the setting of metastatic HNCUP.A retrospective review of institutional records focused on cases of HR-HPV negative HNCUP was conducted.


38393464_.tx.6 All cases were subjected to next generation sequencing analysis to assess UV signature mutations.We identified 14Ã HR-HPV negative metastatic HNCUP to either the cervical or parotid gland lymph nodes, of which, 11 (11/14, 79%) had UV signature mutations, including 4 (4/10, 40%) p16 positive cases.


38393464_.tx.7 All UV signature mutation positive cases had at least one significant TP53 mutation and greater than 20 unique gene mutations.The management of metastatic cutaneous carcinomas significantly differs from other HNCUP especially metastatic HR-HPV-associated SCC; therefore, the observation of a high percentage of CÃ¢  T with CC Ã¢  TT substitutions should be routinely incorporated in next generation sequencing reports of HNCUP.

38392565_PMC10890329.tx.2 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths, and treatment, especially in the metastatic stage, is challenging.


38392565_PMC10890329.tx.3 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized CRC treatment, but response varies, emphasizing the need for effective biomarkers.

38392565_PMC10890329.tx.4 This study explores SPEN mutations as potential biomarkers.


38392565_PMC10890329.tx.5 Using data from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Colorectal Cancer, this research applied bioinformatics tools and statistical analysis to SPEN (Split Ends) mutant and wild-type CRC patients treated with ICIs.

38392565_PMC10890329.tx.6 Focus areas included mutation rates, immune cell infiltration, and DNA damage response pathways.The SPEN mutation rate was found to be 13.8% (15/109 patients) in the MSKCC cohort and 6.65% (35/526 patients) in the TCGA cohort.

38392565_PMC10890329.tx.8 These patients also had higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) scores, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.


38392565_PMC10890329.tx.9 SPEN mutants also exhibited increased DNA damage response (DDR) pathway mutations and a greater presence of activated immune cells, like M1 macrophages and CD8+ T cells, while wild-type patients had more resting/suppressive immune cells.

38392565_PMC10890329.tx.10 Furthermore, distinct mutation patterns, notably with TP53, indicated a unique molecular subtype in SPEN-mutated CRC.We conclude that SPEN mutations might improve ICI efficacy in CRC due to increased immunogenicity and an inflammatory tumor microenvironment.

38392212_PMC10887868.tx.4 In the present study, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling were employed to examine the functions of mutant p53 and to investigate the impact of its complete abolishment.


38392212_PMC10887868.tx.5 Our findings indicate that CRISPR-mediated TP53 knockout results in significant changes at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels.


38392212_PMC10887868.tx.6 The knockout of TP53 significantly increased the migration rate and altered the expression of genes associated with invasion, migration, and EMT but suppressed the epidermal differentiation program.

38388646_.tx.14 The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (27.9%), thrombocytopenia (1.6%), and nausea (1.6%).


38388646_.tx.15 In conclusion, cytarabine monotherapy is an effective and safe regimen for newly diagnosed adults, while baseline lung or Ã¢ Â¥3 involved organs confers poor prognosis.ÃÂ© 2024.

38388477_PMC10883990.tx.2 As CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) approval changed treatment strategies for patients with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer (BC), understanding how exposure to CDK4/6i affects the tumor genomic landscape is critical for precision oncology.


38388477_PMC10883990.tx.3 Using real-world data (RWD) with tumor genomic profiling from 5910 patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- BC, we investigated the evolution of alteration prevalence in commonly mutated genes across patient journeys.

38388477_PMC10883990.tx.4 We found that ESR1 is more often altered in tumors exposed to at least 1Ã¢  year of adjuvant endocrine therapy, contrasting with TP53 alterations.

38388477_PMC10883990.tx.5 We observed a similar trend after first-line treatments in the advanced setting, but strikingly exposure to aromatase inhibitors (AI) combined with CDK4/6i led to significantly higher ESR1 alteration prevalence compared to AI alone, independent of treatment duration.

38388477_PMC10883990.tx.6 Further, CDK4/6i exposure was associated with higher occurrence of concomitant alterations in multiple oncogenic pathways.

38388477_PMC10883990.tx.7 Differences based on CDK4/6i exposure were confirmed in samples collected after 2L and validated in samples from the acelERA BC clinical trial.


38388477_PMC10883990.tx.8 In conclusion, our work uncovers opportunities for further treatment personalization and stresses the need for effective combination treatments to address the altered tumor genomic landscape following AI+CDK4/6i exposure.


38388477_PMC10883990.tx.9 Further, we demonstrated the potential of RWD for refining patient treatment strategy and guiding clinical trial design.ÃÂ© 2024.
